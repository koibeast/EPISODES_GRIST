# EPISODES_GRIST
A repo for grist templates user can use to track which episodes of television/other similar media they've seen, or with who, or how many times. 

Basically just wanting to create files to be used with the Grist project that people can use to track their media. I'm going to start by making tables for the shows I've seen personally (listing all episodes, with basic data on each one). Open to suggestions on how to improve this, I'm aware their are already products for this but I want something that can be accurate while also being editable (in case someone wants to exclude credits from runtime for example). I enjoy tracking my hobbies it makes them more fun for me, so that's basically all this is.
